# GC57 — Experimental Support Material

# Test GC57

This repository collects the test programs used to support and validate
the GC57 factorization approach, as documented in the corresponding
Zenodo publications.

The purpose of this repository is strictly experimental and demonstrative.
It provides reproducible test code aligned with the published documents.

## Repository structure

- `tests/`  
  Contains the main test programs used to validate the GC57 approach.

- `zenodo/`  
  Contains one folder per Zenodo publication.  
  Each folder includes the exact code used to support that specific document.

- `screenshots/`  
  Screenshots referenced in the documentation and README files.

- `archive/`  
  Historical and preliminary code, kept for reference only.  
  This code is not used in the official tests.

## Notes

Only the code contained in `tests/` and `zenodo/` should be considered
relevant for reproducing the results described in the Zenodo publications.
